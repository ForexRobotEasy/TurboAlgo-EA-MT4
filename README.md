## Code Explanation

This code is written in MQL4 and is the entry point of the EA. Here's a brief explanation of the code structure and functionality:

- The necessary libraries and global variables are defined.
- The `OnTick()` function is the entry point of the EA, which is executed on every tick.
- Inside the `OnTick()` function, the market dynamics are checked for potential trading opportunities.
- If the market is oversold and there is a bullish divergence, a buy trade is opened.
- If the market is overbought and there is a bearish divergence, a sell trade is opened.
- The `IsOversoldCondition()` and `IsOverboughtCondition()` functions check the market conditions based on RSI (Relative Strength Index).
- The `IsBullishDivergence()` and `IsBearishDivergence()` functions implement logic to identify bullish and bearish divergences based on AI analysis.
- The `CalculateLotSize()`, `CalculateStopLoss()`, and `CalculateTakeProfit()` functions calculate the lot size, stop loss, and take profit levels respectively, based on risk percentage, account balance, and market volatility.

**Note:** This code is provided as a sample and may require additional customization and testing before using it for live trading. It is recommended to consult with the official developer or perform thorough testing and analysis before deploying this code in a live trading environment.
